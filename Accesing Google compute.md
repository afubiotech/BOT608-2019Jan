A google compute engine has set up. Currently, the instance will be turned on occasionally as needed. I will turn on instance while classes and for some hours for practice. Students needs to coordinate the time to get work done in those times. 

How to connect:

1. For coding, SSH

1. Putty: Please download putty from [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). Make sure you have the right version. The host address, password and key file will be shared differently. 

2. Jupyter terminal: recommended for now. Access through [http://35.211.9.213:5000](http://35.211.9.213:5000). Password will be shared differently. 

2. For file transfer. 

    1. Winscp: [https://winscp.net/eng/index.php](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)
